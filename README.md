# Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) Meet Neural Networks: A Dive Into Deep Learning with Neural ODEs
## Abstract
Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (neural ODEs) represent a paradigm in the field of deep learning, introducing a continuous-time perspective to model the evolution of hidden states in neural networks. This paper provides a comprehensive exploration of Neural ODEs, explaining their fundamental principles, and applications.
The paper begins by introducing the concept of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and their extension into the neural network domain. A detailed analysis of the training process for Neural ODEs is presented, focusing on the adjoint method for gradient computation and backpropagation. 
Several applications of Neural ODEs across diverse domains are explored, including time-series prediction, image recognition, and generative modeling. Furthermore, the paper addresses current challenges and potential avenues for future research in the Neural ODE research. <br>
